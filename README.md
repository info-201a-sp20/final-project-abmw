# Project Brainstorm INFO 201 BA Group 2
### Andrea Argueta, Mariam Khan, Brynna Kilcline, and William Zhang

## Domain of Interest
While the world seems to be in a standstill, we thought we would choose an aspect of many people's lives that serves as a constant: coffee. Coffee is a bridge for people to connect, so looking into it further to see who/where experiences coffee in different ways is very interesting to our group. Our goal is that through this project is to understand the different manners and individuals that consume coffee and how a simple cup of coffee can shape someone's habits.

### Other projects
- This project looked at coffee profiles to compare the quality of coffee, and then ranked the top countries. Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya came in the top three. [(Link)](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-data-speak-ethiopia-has-the-best-coffee-91f88ed37e84)
- This project compares differences in prices for the same cup of coffee in 76 countries. These differences are used to analyze the value of currencies of the 76 countries. [(Link)](https://www.finder.com/starbucks-index)
- The project looks deeper into the caffeine consumption of individuals seeking to understand the different habits wrapping around coffee. This project looks at beverage choice, reason for consuming caffeine, and money spent based on industry consumption. [(Link)](https://amerisleep.com/blog/caffeine-kick/)

### Questions
How is coffee production distributed around the world? (Who are the true coffee lovers?)
_We would want to compare the amount of coffee production, imports, and exports across regions or countries._

Which cultures/countries put most emphasis on coffee? _We could compare data of consumption by country and look at the amount of presence of coffee in different cultures._

What does household coffee consumption look like by country? _We would specifically look for countries that have high coffee intake metrics by household._

## Data
**"Historical Data on the Global Coffee Trade":** This dataset was downloaded from  http://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp. The data was collected from the International Coffee Organization and looks at countries as a whole and into the quantities of distributing countries. There are 31 columns and 68 rows for the “Total Production” dataset. The question we would answer above concerns “how coffee production is distributed around the world.”

**PSD Coffee Dataset:** The dataset was downloaded from https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/app/index.html#/app/downloads.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) collects data from agency activities which are then summarized into reports. The file consists of data about coffee bean production, export, import and consumption for every country by year. There are 72752 observations and 11 features, 8 of which have more than one unique value across all observations. This data answers question 1 by providing data on coffee bean production, export and import for different countries. It can also answer question 2 with data on domestic consumption per country.

**"Coffee Prices - 45 Year Historical Chart":** This data is from macrotrends: https://www.macrotrends.net/2535/coffee-prices-historical-chart-data. This data looks at coffee prices from 1969 to 2020. It is not specified who collected the data, so we will have to be careful in trusting this source. There are at least 11,000 rows, and there are two columns, date and price. This data set will help us answer what cultures/countries consume coffee and how it may have affected them economically.

**Global Consumption Database for Coffee, Tea and Cocoa:** This data was collected from the World Bank at http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/product/Coffee,-Tea-and-Cocoa; they collected the data using sample surveys to understand the area segments in which coffee consumption per household was highest. They also created ranges which demonstrate the household coffee consumption by rural, urban, and national areas. There are 10 columns and 4,051 rows within the dataset. The questions from above that can be answered using this dataset could be “what does household consumption look like by country?”
