# Project Brainstorm INFO 201 BA Group 2
### Andrea Argueta, Mariam Khan, Brynna Kilcline, and William Zhang

## Domain of Interest
While the world seems to be in a standstill, we thought we would choose an aspect of many people's lives that serves as a constant: coffee. Coffee is a bridge for people to connect, so looking into it further to see who/where experiences coffee in different ways is very interesting to our group. Our goal is that through this project is to understand the different manners and individuals that consume coffee and how a simple cup of coffee can shape someone's habits.

### Other projects
- This project looked at coffee profiles to compare the quality of coffee, and then ranked the top countries. Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya came in the top three. [(Link)](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-data-speak-ethiopia-has-the-best-coffee-91f88ed37e84)
- This project compares differences in prices for the same cup of coffee in 76 countries. These differences are used to analyze the value of currencies of the 76 countries. [(Link)](https://www.finder.com/starbucks-index)
- The project looks deeper into the caffeine consumption of individuals seeking to understand the different habits wrapping around coffee.

### Questions
How is coffee production distributed around the world? (Who are the true coffee lovers?)
_We would want to compare the amount of coffee production, imports, and exports across regions or countries._

Which cultures/countries put most emphasis on coffee? _We could compare data of consumption by country and look at the amount of presence of coffee in different cultures._

What time (of the day) do people drink coffee the most? _We would specifically look for time periods that have high coffee intake metrics within our datasets._
